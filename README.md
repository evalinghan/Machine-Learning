# Machine Learning

Here you'll find an example jupyter notebook script that I produced for my final exam in CS155: Machine Learning and Data Mining at Caltech.
In this project I employed a large variety of regressors, ensemble methods, and metamodels in order to make predictions on a complex data set.
This problem also shows what I can produce on a realistic timeline - since I only had a few hours to solve this problem.

For this script you'll need the following packages: sklearn, tensorflow, keras, xgboost, lightgbm

I recommend installing these in an anaconda virtual environment to make sure that tensorflow will be imported correctly.
