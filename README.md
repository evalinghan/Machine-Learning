# Machine Learning

Here you'll find an example jupyter notebook script that I produced for my final exam in CS155: Machine Learning and Data Mining at Caltech.

For the final, we were provided with a training data set of factors that may affect queue wait times for a company as well as the actual wait times for each entry. 

We were then provided a test data set of recorded factors for a new set of entries. The goal of the project was to predict what the queue wait times would be for this new set of entries.

In this project I employed a large variety of regressors, ensemble methods, and metamodels in order to make predictions on the complex data set. This problem also shows what I can produce on a realistic timeline - since I only had a few hours to solve this problem.

For this script you'll need the following packages: sklearn, tensorflow, keras, xgboost, lightgbm. I recommend installing these in an anaconda virtual environment to make sure that tensorflow will be imported correctly.
